# XGBoost_TBBE

This is the extended version from Multi-threaded BBE integrated with Opinion Dynamics Platform (https://github.com/Guzelyte/TBBE_OD). 

This version integrated an agent called XGBoostbettingagent to the original 'betting_agents.py' file in the Application folder. This agent uses the model trained from https://github.com/ChawinT/XGBoost_ModelTraining to make the prediction. Moreover, this version also added a function called 'getXGboostTrainData' to 'session_stats.py' file to collects/gather data for XGboost model training.
